# gemini-automator
Gemini Automator is a Python automation script that leverages Selenium to interact with Gemini's AI image generation platform. The script takes in a list of prompts, automatically types them into Gemini, waits for the image to generate, and retrieves the image URL. It is designed to speed up the image generation process with minimal manual input.
